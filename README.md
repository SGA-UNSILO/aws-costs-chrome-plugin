# aws-costs-chrome-plugin

Intended to inline costs from us-east-1 in chrome, when navigating EC2 instances.

The code is, at best, POC-crap quality, but might still be helpful to others.

To install, clone repo into some folder ("aws-costs-plugin"), open chrome, go to chrome://extensions, enable developer mode, click "load unpacked" and select the directory. 

The plugin will auto-run on AWS sites, and AWS sites only.
