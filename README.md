# aws-costs-chrome-plugin

Intended to inline costs from AWS regions chrome, when navigating EC2 instances.

The code is, at best, POC-crap quality, but might still be helpful to others.

To install, clone repo into some folder ("aws-costs-plugin"), open chrome, go to chrome://extensions, enable developer mode, click "load unpacked" and select the directory, or use whatever version I've last uploaded to the chrome store on: https://chrome.google.com/webstore/detail/aws-costs-plugin/djfpendnbkafpjbpfamplhfciapjakkm

The plugin also works on Firefox if you either sideload it, or self-sign it, but I've not uploaded it publicly into their store.

The plugin will auto-run on AWS sites, and AWS sites only.
